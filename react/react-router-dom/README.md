# React Router DOM

Here's a detailed explanation of key topics related to React Router for beginner developers:

### 1. **BrowserRouter**:

-   **Purpose**: Acts as the router provider for the app. It manages the URL changes and ensures components are rendered based on the current URL.
-   **Usage**: Wrap the entire application in `<BrowserRouter>` to enable routing.

```jsx
import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";
<BrowserRouter>
    <App />
</BrowserRouter>;
```

### 2. **Routes & Route**:

-   **Purpose**: Defines the routes in the application and maps URL paths to components. Each `<Route>` specifies a path and the component to render.
-   **Usage**: `<Routes>` wraps multiple `<Route>` components.

```jsx
import { Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
<Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
    <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
</Routes>;
```

### 3. **Link**:

-   **Purpose**: Used for navigation between routes without reloading the page, replacing traditional anchor (`<a>`) tags.
-   **Usage**: `<Link>` creates a clickable link that changes the route.

```jsx
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
<Link to="/about">Go to About</Link>;
```

### 4. **useParams**:

-   **Purpose**: Extracts dynamic URL parameters from the route. Useful for routes that include variables (e.g., `/user/:id`).
-   **Usage**: In a component rendered by a route with parameters, `useParams` returns the parameter values.

```jsx
import { useParams } from "react-router-dom";
const User = () => {
    const { id } = useParams();
    return <div>User ID: {id}</div>;
};
```

### 5. **useNavigate**:

-   **Purpose**: Programmatically navigate to different routes. It allows redirection within a component based on some logic (e.g., after a form submission).
-   **Usage**: `useNavigate` returns a function to navigate to different routes.

```jsx
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";
const Home = () => {
    const navigate = useNavigate();
    const goToAbout = () => navigate("/about");
    return <button onClick={goToAbout}>Go to About</button>;
};
```

### 6. **useLocation**:

-   **Purpose**: Provides access to the current URL location object, including the pathname, search query, and hash.
-   **Usage**: It can be used to track the current route or pass state between routes.

```jsx
import { useLocation } from "react-router-dom";
const CurrentPage = () => {
    const location = useLocation();
    return <div>Current Path: {location.pathname}</div>;
};
```

### 7. **Nested Routes**:

-   **Purpose**: Organizes routes hierarchically, where child components are rendered within parent components based on nested URLs.
-   **Usage**: Use nested `<Route>` components inside the parent route.

```jsx
<Routes>
    <Route path="/dashboard" element={<Dashboard />}>
        <Route path="settings" element={<Settings />} />
    </Route>
</Routes>
```

### 8. **Switch vs. Routes**:

-   **Switch** (used in older versions) rendered the first matching route, while **Routes** (in React Router v6) checks for exact matches and supports nested routes more efficiently.

These topics should give beginner developers a comprehensive foundation for using React Router in modern React applications. Would you like further details or examples on any of these topics?

### 1. **Installation**

First, install React Router DOM in your project:

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

### 2. **Setting Up React Router**

In the latest version of React Router (v6), you define routes using the `<Routes>` and `<Route>` components inside the `App.js` or any parent component:

```jsx
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import Home from "./pages/Home";
import About from "./pages/About";

function App() {
    return (
        <Router>
            <Routes>
                <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
                <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
            </Routes>
        </Router>
    );
}

export default App;
```

-   `<Router>` wraps the entire app to enable routing.
-   `<Routes>` is a wrapper around the routes; it replaces the older `<Switch>`.
-   `<Route>` defines individual routes with the `path` and `element` props. `element` replaces the older `component` prop.

### 3. **Using Links for Navigation**

React Router uses the `<Link>` component to navigate between pages without refreshing the browser:

```jsx
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

function Navbar() {
    return (
        <nav>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <Link to="/">Home</Link>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <Link to="/about">About</Link>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </nav>
    );
}

export default Navbar;
```

### 4. **Using Parameters in Routes**

To pass parameters to a route, define it with a colon (`:`) in the path, and retrieve the parameters with `useParams`:

```jsx
import { useParams } from "react-router-dom";

function User() {
    const { id } = useParams();

    return <h1>User ID: {id}</h1>;
}
```

Define the route like this:

```jsx
<Route path="/user/:id" element={<User />} />
```

### 5. **Navigating Programmatically**

You can use the `useNavigate` hook to programmatically navigate to a route:

```jsx
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";

function Dashboard() {
    const navigate = useNavigate();

    const goToHome = () => {
        navigate("/");
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Dashboard</h1>
            <button onClick={goToHome}>Go to Home</button>
        </div>
    );
}
```

### 6. **Handling 404 Pages (Not Found)**

If no route matches the user's request, you can define a "catch-all" route with `path="*"`, often used for 404 pages:

```jsx
<Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
```

### 7. **Nested Routes**

React Router allows you to create nested routes, which are useful for layouts. Use `Outlet` to render the nested content.

```jsx
import { Outlet, Link } from "react-router-dom";

function Dashboard() {
    return (
        <div>
            <nav>
                <Link to="analytics">Analytics</Link>
                <Link to="reports">Reports</Link>
            </nav>
            <Outlet />
        </div>
    );
}
```

Define the nested routes:

```jsx
<Route path="dashboard" element={<Dashboard />}>
    <Route path="analytics" element={<Analytics />} />
    <Route path="reports" element={<Reports />} />
</Route>
```

### 8. **Protected Routes**

For routes that require authentication, you can create a wrapper component:

```jsx
import { Navigate } from "react-router-dom";

function ProtectedRoute({ isAuthenticated, children }) {
    if (!isAuthenticated) {
        return <Navigate to="/login" />;
    }
    return children;
}
```

Use it in your route definition:

```jsx
<Route
    path="/dashboard"
    element={
        <ProtectedRoute isAuthenticated={isAuthenticated}>
            <Dashboard />
        </ProtectedRoute>
    }
/>
```

### Key Changes in React Router v6:

-   **No more `component` or `render` props**: Use `element` instead.
-   **`<Switch>` is now `<Routes>`**: Itâ€™s simpler and clearer.
-   **No need for `exact` keyword**: All routes match exactly by default unless nested.
-   **Hooks for Navigation**: Use `useNavigate` instead of history for programmatic navigation.
