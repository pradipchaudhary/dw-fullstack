# Rest Operator (`...`)

The rest operator (`...`) in JavaScript is a powerful feature introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015). It allows you to collect multiple elements and condense them into a single array. The rest operator is used in function parameters and destructuring assignments. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation with examples:

### In Function Parameters

The rest operator can be used to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array.

#### Example:

```javascript
function sum(...numbers) {
    return numbers.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0);
}

console.log(sum(1, 2, 3)); // Output: 6
console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)); // Output: 15
```

In this example, the `sum` function can take any number of arguments. The rest operator `...numbers` collects all the arguments passed to the function and puts them into an array called `numbers`.

### In Array Destructuring

The rest operator can also be used to gather the rest of the elements in an array into a new array.

#### Example:

```javascript
const [first, second, ...rest] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(first); // Output: 1
console.log(second); // Output: 2
console.log(rest); // Output: [3, 4, 5]
```

Here, the first two elements of the array are assigned to `first` and `second`, respectively, and the rest of the elements are gathered into an array called `rest`.

### In Object Destructuring

Similarly, the rest operator can be used in object destructuring to collect the remaining properties of an object.

#### Example:

```javascript
const person = { name: "John", age: 30, job: "Developer" };
const { name, ...rest } = person;
console.log(name); // Output: John
console.log(rest); // Output: { age: 30, job: 'Developer' }
```

In this case, the `name` property is extracted from the `person` object, and the rest of the properties are gathered into a new object called `rest`.

### Summary

The rest operator (`...`) is a versatile and useful feature in JavaScript for handling function arguments and destructuring arrays and objects. It provides a concise and readable way to work with collections of elements or properties.
